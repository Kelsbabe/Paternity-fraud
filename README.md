# Paternity-fraud
Paternity fraud, a topic often excluded from mainstream public discourse, carries serious emotional, legal, and psychological consequences. This project seeks to quantify its prevalence, causes, societal perception, and preferred interventions through data analytics.

Paternity fraud is a social and legal issue that affects family structures, emotional well-being, and legal responsibilities. Through a carefully designed survey, this project collected and analyzed responses from 201 individuals across multiple countries, professions, and age groups.

The objective was to use data science to:

- Identify levels of awareness around paternity fraud
- Understand common causes and affected parties
- Explore public opinion on how governments and institutions should intervene
- Present recommendations based on data-driven evidence
